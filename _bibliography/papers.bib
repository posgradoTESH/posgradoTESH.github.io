  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

The closed-loop stability is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov-like analysis. With the aim of verifying the feasibility and performance of the proposed approach, a comparison with an active control algorithm is developed at the numerical simulation level. Based on such results, the master-slave Nwachioma chaotic system in closed-loop with adaptive control is now being experimentally tested by using two personal computers and two low-cost Arduino UNO boards. The experimental results not only show the good performance of the adaptive control but also that Arduino UNO boards are an excellent option for the experimental setup.},

  abstract={In this investigation, a tracking control is designed for the angular velocity of the DC/DC Boost converter–DC motor system. To this end, the dynamics of the power supply, generated through a renewable energy power source, is considered in both the mathematical model and the designed control. This latter is proposed by using a two-level hierarchical approach, where the dynamics of the DC/DC Boost converter and the one associated with the DC motor not only are treated as two independent subsystems, but also they exploit their differential flatness property. For the DC/DC Boost converter, an alternative first-order mathematical model is obtained for designing the low-level voltage control. Whereas, the well known second order mathematical model of the DC motor is used for developing the high-level angular velocity control. The robustness and performance of the hierarchical tracking control are verified via realistic numerical simulations and experimental results by using Matlab-Simulink, a prototype of the system, the DS1104 board, and the renewable energy emulator TDK-Lambda G100-17. The results demonstrate and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract={By developing a robust control strategy based on the differential flatness concept, this paper presents a solution for the bidirectional trajectory tracking task in the “full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor” system. The robustness of the proposed control is achieved by taking advantage of the differential flatness property related to the mathematical model of the system. The performance of the control, designed via the flatness concept, is verified in two ways. The first is by implementing experimentally the flatness control and proposing different shapes for the desired angular velocity profiles. For this aim, a built prototype of the “full-bridge Buck inverter–DC motor” system, along with Matlab–Simulink and a DS1104 board from dSPACE are used. The second is via simulation results, i.e., by programming the system in closed-loop with the proposed control algorithm through Matlab–Simulink. The experimental and the simulation results are similar, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the designed robust control even when abrupt electrical variations are considered in the system.},

  abstract={In order to solve the trajectory tracking task in a wheeled mobile robot (WMR), a dynamic three-level controller is presented in this paper. The controller considers the mechanical structure, actuators, and power stage subsystems. Such a controller is designed as follows: At the high level is a dynamic control for the WMR (differential drive type). At the medium level is a PI current control for the actuators (DC motors). Lastly, at the low level is a differential flatness-based control for the power stage (DC/DC Buck power converters). The feasibility, robustness, and performance in closed-loop of the proposed controller are validated on a DDWMR prototype through Matlab-Simulink, the real-time interface ControlDesk, and a DS1104 board. The obtained results are experimentally assessed with a hierarchical tracking controller, recently reported in literature, that was also designed on the basis of the mechanical structure, actuators, and power stage subsystems. Although both controllers are robust when parametric disturbances are taken into account, the dynamic three-level tracking controller presented in this paper is better than the hierarchical tracking controller reported in literature.},

  abstract={In this research, a proportional integral derivative regulator, a first-order sliding-mode regulator, and a second-order sliding-mode regulator are compared, for the regulation of two different types of mathematical model. A first-order sliding-mode regulator is a method where a sign-mapping checks that the error decays to zero after a convergence time; it has the problem of chattering in the output. A second-order sliding-mode regulator is a smooth method to counteract the chattering effect where the integral of the sign-mapping is used. A second-order sliding-mode regulator is presented as a new class of algorithm where the trajectory is asymptotic and stable; it is shown to greatly improve the convergence time in comparison with other regulators considered. Simulation and experimental results are described in which an electric oven is considered as a stable linear mathematical model, and an inverted pendulum is considered as an asymmetrical unstable non-linear mathematical model.},

The adapting strategy is used for the unknown dynamics estimation, and the H-infinity strategy is used for the desired reference tracking.

They are termed as novel nonlinear hypothesis and second order nonlinear hypothesis and their goal is to improve the second order processes modeling.

  abstract={In this work, we carried out an asymptotic analysis, up to the second order in a regular expansion, of the interaction between linear long waves and two submerged breakwaters of wavy surfaces, which obey a sinusoidal profile. The governing equations are expressed in their dimensionless version. The boundary conditions at the breakwaters surfaces are non-homogeneous; therefore, they are linearized using the domain perturbation method. Breakwaters with wavy surfaces generate larger reflection coefficient values than those obtained for breakwaters with flat surfaces. The largest values of this coefficient are obtained when the breakwater’s length is of the same order of magnitude as the wavelength. The asymptotic solution is compared with classical analytical solutions and the results are in good agreement. The present asymptotic solution can be used as a practical reference for the selection of the geometric configuration of a submerged floating breakwater under shallow flow conditions.},

  abstract={In this work we develop a theoretical analysis for the mass transfer of an electroneutral solute in a concentric-annulus microchannel driven by an oscillatory electroosmotic flow (OEOF) of a fluid whose behavior follows the Maxwell model. The annular microchannel connects two reservoirs that have different concentrations of the solute. For the mathematical modeling of the OEOF, we assume the Debye-Hückel approximation and that the wall zeta potentials of the micro-annulus can be symmetric or asymmetric. The governing equations are nondimensionalized, from which the following dimensionless parameters appear: an angular Reynolds number, the ratio of the wall zeta potentials of the annular microchannel, the electrokinetic parameter, the dimensionless gap between the two cylinders, the Schmidt number and the elasticity number. The results indicate that the velocity and concentration distributions across the annular microchannel become non-uniform as the angular Reynolds number increases, and depend notably on the elasticity number. It is also revealed that with a suitable combination of values of the elasticity number and gap between the two cylinders, together with the angular Reynolds number, the total mass transport rate can be increased and the species separation can be controlled.},

To describe the flow and electrical fields, the lubrication and Debye-Hückel approximations are used. The simplified governing equations of continuity, momentum, and Poisson-Boltzmann, together with the boundary conditions, are presented in dimensionless form. For solving the mathematical problem, numerical and asymptotic techniques were applied. The asymptotic solution is obtained in the limit of very thin electric double layers (EDLs). We show that the lubrication theory is a powerful technique for solving the hydrodynamic field in electroosmotic flows in microchannels where the amplitude of the waviness changes on the order of the mean semi-channel height. Approximate analytical expressions for the velocity components and pressure distribution are derived, and a closed formula for the volumetric flow rate is obtained. The results show that the principal parameters that govern this EOF are the geometrical parameter, ε, which characterizes the waviness of the microchannel, and the ratio of the mean semi-channel height to the thickness of the EDL, κ¯.},
